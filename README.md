# SEO Optimization and Accessibility Analysis Flask Application

This project is a Flask-based web application designed to analyze SEO performance, page accessibility, and various web metrics for a given URL. It includes a series of custom functions to assess parameters like page load time, HTTPS support, metadata availability, image optimization, and more. The tool outputs an SEO score, accessibility insights, and additional diagnostic data to help improve a website's SEO and user experience.

## Features

- **SEO Score Calculation**: Analyzes key SEO factors and provides an overall score based on parameters such as load time, HTTPS presence, meta tags, image optimization, and mobile-friendliness.
- **Accessibility Analysis**: Checks for alt attributes on images, labels on form inputs, heading structure, and ARIA attributes for accessibility.
- **Performance Metrics**:
  - **Ping Time**: Measures response time from the server.
  - **DNS Response Time**: Calculates the time taken for DNS resolution.
  - **Time to First Byte (TTFB)**: Measures the time it takes for the server to start responding.
- **Meta Data Extraction**: Fetches the title and description of the website, if available.
- **Content Size Analysis**: Determines the size of the page content in KB.
